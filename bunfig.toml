# Security Scanner API: Automatically scans packages before installation
# Blocks vulnerable packages before installation
#
# NOTE: Temporarily disabled - causes silent failure with bun 1.3.4+
# The bun-osv-scanner silently fails during installation,
# causing exit code 1 without any visible error message.
#
# To re-enable the scanner:
# 1. Check for known issues: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues
# 2. Test with a newer version of bun-osv-scanner
# 3. Or use another compatible scanner: @socketsecurity/bun-security-scanner
# 4. Uncomment the lines below
#
# [install.security]
# scanner = "bun-osv-scanner"
