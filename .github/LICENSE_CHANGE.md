# License Change Notice

## Important Change

The AppStandard Calendar project has migrated from an **MIT** license to **AGPL v3** (GNU Affero General Public License v3).

## Date of Change

December 2024

## What Changes

### Before (MIT)
- Free use, modification, and distribution
- No restrictions on commercial exploitation
- No restrictions on public instances
- No obligation to share modifications

### Now (AGPL v3)
- Code remains freely viewable
- GitHub forks allowed for contributions
- Private instances allowed (local or small private circle)
- Personal modifications allowed (for private use)
- **Public instances**: If you deploy publicly, you **must** share the source code of your modifications
- **Commercial use**: If you use commercially, you **must** share the source code of your modifications
- **Same license**: Your modifications must also be under AGPL v3

## For Existing Users

If you obtained the code under the MIT license before this date, you may continue to use that version under MIT. New versions will be under AGPL v3.

## Why This Change?

AGPL v3 was chosen to:
- **Protect the work**: Prevent secret exploitation of the code
- **Encourage sharing**: Force sharing of improvements
- **Maintain transparency**: Ensure the source code remains accessible
